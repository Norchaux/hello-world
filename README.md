# hello-world

I like working with Linux and using Python and learning new languages. It's only a hobby now, but i find it does help me at my current job with helping to automate repetitve tasks or using the concept in other applications like Excel.

I also like road and mountain biking (follow me on Strava!), hiking, camping, and spending time outside.
